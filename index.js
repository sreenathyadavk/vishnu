        'Matsya':"Matsya (Sanskrit: मत्स्य, lit. fish)\
        is the fish avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu.\
         Often described as the first of Vishnu's ten primary avatars, \
         Matsya is described to have rescued the first man, Manu,\
        from a great deluge. Matsya may be depicted as a giant fish,\
         often golden in color, or anthropomorphically with the torso\
          of Vishnu connected to the rear half of a fish.\
          The tale of Matsya also appears in chapter 12.187 of the Book 3, the Vana Parva, in the epic Mahabharata. The legend begins with Manu (specifically Vaivasvata Manu, the present Manu. Manu is envisioned as a title, rather than an individual) performing religious rituals on the banks of the Chirini River in Vishāla forest. A little fish comes to him and asks for his protection, promising to save him from a deluge in the future. The legend moves in the same vein as the Vedic version. Manu places him in the jar. Once it outgrows the jar, the fish asks to be put into a tank which Manu helps with. Then the fish outgrows the tank, and with Manu's help reaches the Ganges River (Ganga), finally to the ocean. Manu is asked by the fish, as in the Shatapatha Brahmana version, to build a ship and additionally, to be in it with Saptarishi (seven sages) and all sorts of seeds, on the day of the expected deluge. Manu accepts the fish's advice. The deluge begins. The fish arrives to Manu's aid. He ties the ship with a rope to the horn of the fish, who then steers the ship to the Himalayas, carrying Manu through a turbulent storm. The danger passes. The fish then reveals himself as Brahma and gives the power of creation to Manu."
          ,
          'Kurma':"Kurma (Sanskrit: कूर्म; Kurma, 'Turtle', 'Tortoise'), is the second avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu. Originating in Vedic literature such as the Yajurveda as being synonymous with the Saptarishi called Kasyapa, Kurma is most commonly associated in post-Vedic literature such as the Puranas with the legend of the churning of the Ocean of Milk, referred to as the Samudra Manthan. Along with being synonymous with Akupara, the World-Turtle supporting the Earth, Kurma is listed as the second Dashavatara"
        ,
        'Varaha':"Varaha (Sanskrit: वराह, Varāha, 'boar') is the avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, in the form of a boar. Varaha is generally listed as third in the Dashavatara, the ten principal avatars of Vishnu.\
        Varaha is most commonly associated with the legend of lifting the Earth (personified as the goddess Bhudevi) out of the cosmic ocean. When the demon Hiranyaksha stole the earth and hid her in the primordial waters, Vishnu appeared as Varaha to rescue her. Varaha slew the demon and retrieved the Earth from the ocean, lifting it on his tusks, and restored Bhudevi to her place in the universe. \
        Varaha may be depicted as completely a boar or in an anthropomorphic form, with a boar's head and the human body. His consort, Bhudevi, the earth, is often depicted as a young woman, lifted by Varaha."
        ,
        'Varaha':'The Mahabharata lays the foundation for the avatar concept in Vishnu theology; the term pradurbhava ("manifestation") appears in the early lists, instead the term avatar. Varaha is listed as one of the four incarnations of Narayana-Vishnu who "relieve the burden of the earth" in an early list; in another list which may be a later addition to the epic, Varaha is one among eight pradurbhavas. Some manuscripts of the epic expand the list to the classical ten Dashavatar list; with Varaha listed as third or fourth pradurbhava.'
        ,
        'Narasimha':'He is the fourth avatar of Vishnu. Narasimha is depicted with three eyes, and is described as the God of Destruction, who destroys the entire universe at the time of great-dissolution (Mahapralaya). Hence he is known as Kala (time) or Mahakala (great-time) or Parakala (beyond time) as well. There is even a matha (monastery) by the name of Parakala Matha in Sri Vaishnava tradition. Alongside, Narasimha is also described as the God of Yoga, in the form of Yoga-Narasimha\
        Narasimha iconography shows him with a human torso and lower body, with a lion face and claws, typically with a demon Hiranyakashipu in his lap whom he is in the process of defeating. The demon is the powerful brother of evil Hiranyaksha who had been previously defeated by Vishnu, and thus hated the latter.\
        Hiranyakashipu gained special powers by which he could not be killed during the day or night, inside or outside the house, any place in the world i.e. neither in sky nor on land nor in heaven nor in pataala, by any weapon, and by man, god, asura or animal. Endowed with this, he began to create chaos and havoc, persecuting all devotees of Vishnu, including his own son.\
        Vishnu understood the demon`s power and creatively adapted into a mixed avatar that is neither man nor animal and kills the demon at the junction of day and night, inside and outside. Narasimha is known primarily as the "Great Protector" who specifically defends and protects his devotees from evil. The most popular Narasimha mythology is the legend that protects his devotee Prahlada, and creatively destroys Prahlada`s demonic father and tyrant Hiranyakashipu'
        ,
        'Vamana':'The Dashavatara (/ˌdəʃɑːvˈtɑːr/; Sanskrit: दशावतार, daśāvatāra) are the ten primary avatars of Vishnu, a principal Hindu god. Vishnu is said to descend in the form of an avatar to restore cosmic order. The word Dashavatara derives from daśa, meaning "ten", and avatāra, roughly equivalent to "incarnation".\
        Originating in the Vedas, Vamana is most commonly associated in the Hindu epics and Puranas with the legend of taking back the three worlds (collectively referred to as the Triloka) from the Asura-King Bali in three steps to give back to Indra. He is youngest among the Adityas, the sons of Aditi and the sage Kashyapa.\
        "Bali" (बलि), also known as "Mahabali" (`Great Bali`), `Bali Mahārāja` ("King Bali"), and "Baskali" ("of a teacher") is the name of the Noble Asura king defeated by the Vamana incarnation of Vishnu. Bali is stated in Puranic literature to be the great-great grandson of Kasyapa and Diti; great-grandson of Hiranyakashipu (son of Diti , defeated by the Narasimha incarnation) grandson of Prahlada (a Vaishnava protected by Narasimha) and son of Virochana.\
        Bali is also stated to have had 100 sons (including Bana) as well as a daughter called Ratnamala. Ratnamala is particularly notable, as after seeing Vamana at her father`s yajna, she desired to have a son just like Him to feed from her own breasts. This desire was granted by Vishnu, hence incarnating at the demoness Putana, who attempted to kill baby Krishna (Vishnu) by breastfeeding Him poison'
,
    'Parashurama':'Parashurama (Sanskrit: परशुराम, romanized: Paraśurāma, lit. `Rama with an axe`), also referred to as Rama Jamadagnya, Rama Bhargava and Veerarama, is the sixth avatar among the Dashavatara of the preserver god Vishnu in Hinduism. He is believed to be one of the Chiranjeevis (Immortals), who will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga to be the guru of Vishnu`s tenth and last incarnation, Kalki. He possessed a number of traits, which included not only aggression, warfare and valour, but also serenity, prudence, and patience.\
    According to Hindu mythology, Parashurama is born to the sage Jamadagni and his Kshatriya wife, Renuka, living in a hut (Believed in local tradition to be located at Janapav). They had a celestial cow called Surabhi, which gives them all that they desire (Surabhi is the daughter of cow Kamadhenu) A king named Kartavirya Arjuna (not to be confused with Arjuna, the Pandava) – learns about this cow of plenty and wants it. He asks Jamadagni to give it to him, but the sage refuses. While Parashurama is away from the hut, the king takes it by force.[4] When Jamadagni pleads his case and seeks for the return of the cow, the king strikes him with his fist, killing him. Parashurama learns about this crime, and is upset. With his axe in his hand, he challenges the king to battle. They fight, and Parashurama defeats and kills the king, according to the Padma Purana'
    ,'Rama':'Sanskrit: राम), Ram, Raman or Ramar,[α] also known as Ramachandra , Sanskrit: रामचन्द्र), is a major deity in Hinduism. He is the seventh and one of the most popular avatars of Vishnu. In Rama-centric traditions of Hinduism, he is considered the Supreme Being.\
    Rama is said to have been born to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, the ruler of the Kingdom of Kosala. His siblings included Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. He married Sita. Though born in a royal family, their life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, ethical questions and moral dilemmas. Of all their travails, the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king Ravana, followed by the determined and epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds. The entire life story of Rama, Sita and their companions allegorically discusses duties, rights and social responsibilities of an individual. It illustrates dharma and dharmic living through model characters.\
    The ancient epic Ramayana states in the Balakhanda that Rama and his brothers were born to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, a city on the banks of Sarayu River'

,'Krishna':'"I am the conscience in the heart of all creatures I am their beginning, their being, their end I am the mind of the senses, I am the radiant sun among lights ,I am the song in sacred lore, I am the king of deities,I am the priest of great seers…"\
This is how Lord Krishna describes God in the Holy Gita. And to most Hindus, he is the God himself, the Supreme Being or the Purna Purushottam.\
For generations, Krishna has been an enigma to some, but God to millions, who go ecstatic even as they hear his name. People consider Krishna their leader, hero, protector, philosopher, teacher and friend all rolled into one. Krishna has influenced the Indian thought, life, and culture in myriad ways. He has influenced not only its religion and philosophy, but also into its mysticism and literature, painting and sculpture, dance and music, and all aspects of Indian folklore.'


,'BalaRama':'Oppressed by millions of Deityas (Asuras) in the guise of arrogant kings, Mother EARTH sought BRAHMA as her refuge. Brahma accompanied by Lord Shiva and other celestials went to the abode of Lord Vishnu. There he began to pray with concentrated mind. At a stage he was in the state of deep trance. At that time he heard a voice in the sky the source of which was invisible. The Creator, while still in that state heard, "Hear from me, O! Gods, the word of the Supreme person. Then set at once. The infliction of Mother Earth had already been known among the Yadus. Lord Vishnu himself will be born in the house of Vasudeva. All the celestial women will be born as Gopis. The thousand headed Ananta (Aadisesha), the cosmic Serpent will precede Him as His elder brother. The rest, the Lord will take care, Himself". Hearing these words all returned to their abode.\
Once Lord Naraayana said to AdiSesha, "Ananta during my Rama incarnation you were born as my younger brother Lakshmana and served me devotedly. I am pleased with it. In another incarnation I will be born as your younger brother and would like to serve you - even adore you".'


,'Kalki':'In Hinduism, Lord Vishnu is one of the triumvirates of God namely Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar. Among these three triumvirates of God Lord Brahma is believed to be the creator of the universe, Lord Maheshwar, i.e., Lord Shiva is known to the destroyer and Lord Vishnu is believed to be the preserver or protector of the whole universe.\
According to Hindus, it is said that Lord Vishnu came to earth many times as a human being for restoring the balance between the good and evil. It is said that Lord Vishnu has already incarnated in the earth about twenty-five times and Lord Kalki will be the last and final incarnation of Lord Vishnu.\
Hindus depicted the picture of Lord Vishnu as reclining on a large snake bed in the Cosmos Ocean where he is in deep meditative sleep along with Lakshmi who is offering her service to the Lord Vishnu.\
Apart from that in the portrait of Lord Vishnu, it is seen that a lotus blossomed from the belly of Lord Vishnu and gave birth to Lord Brahma. In the portrait, it is also seen that Lord Brahma who has created the world is paying his respect to the Lord Vishnu.\
But the appearance of Kalki Avatar of Lord Vishnu is believed to be the Lord of the universe and in Hinduism, the picture of Lord Kalki is portrayed as the Lord is riding on his horse Devadatta with a sword in his hand. This appearance of Lord Kalki is found in the Srimad Bhagavatam.'
